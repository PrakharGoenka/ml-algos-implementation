# ml-algos-implementation
Implementations of basic (beginner level) ML Algorithms as part of undergrad level, semester long assignment.

Assignment - 1:
Develop linear regression models for the given data using the following methods:

Part A - Gradient Descent Method
Part B - Stochastic Gradient Descent Method
Part C - Gradient Descent Method along with regularization
Part D - Normal Equations Method

Data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/3D+Road+Network+(North+Jutland%2C+Denmark)

Assignment - 2:
Develop polynomial regression models for the given data using the following methods:

Part A - Gradient Descent Method, of degrees 1-6 by minimizing the loss function.
Part B - Compare the models by computing the sum of squares of error, R2 and RMSE for
	each of the four polynomial models that have been developed in PART A.
Part C - Gradient Descent Method along with regularization

Data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/3D+Road+Network+(North+Jutland%2C+Denmark)

Assignment - 3:
Generate a dataset randomly for 160 coin tosses and find the distribution followed by the mean of the coin tosses after
observing the data points using the following methods:

Part A - Sequential Learning
Part B - Considering the entire data at once 
Part C - Comment on the differences/similarities between the two models obtained.
